## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is your hiring process? When will I hear about next steps?

This take home assignment is the first step in our hiring process, followed by a final round interview if it goes well. **We review every take home assignment submission and promise to get back to you either way within one week (usually sooner).** The only caveat is if we are out of the office, in which case we will get back to you when we return. If it has been more than one week and you have not heard from us, please do follow up.

The final round interview is a 2-hour technical work session that reflects what it is like to work here. We provide a $150 stipend for your time for the final round interview regardless of how it goes. After that, there may be a short chat with our director about your experience and the role.

Our hiring process is rolling where we review candidates until we have filled our openings. If there are no openings left, we will keep your contact information on file and reach out when we are hiring again.

### How do you decide who to hire?

We evaluate candidates based on three criteria:

- Technical ability (as demonstrated in the take home and final round)
- Customer service orientation (as this role is customer facing)
- Alignment with our values (captured [here](https://www.notion.so/qawolf/QA-Wolf-QA-Engineer-Remote-156203a1e476459ea5e6ffca972d0efe))

This means whether we hire you is based on how you do during our interview process, not on your previous experience (or lack thereof). Note that you will also need to pass a background check to work here as our customers require this.

### How can I help my application stand out?

We've found that our best hires have been the most enthusiastic throughout our process. If you are very excited about working here, please feel free to go above and beyond on this assignment.
